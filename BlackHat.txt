Title: BADUSB-C: Revisiting BadUSB with Type-C

Track: Mobile

Secondary: Hardware / Embedded

Format: 30 Minute Breifing

Format Delivery: UNDECIDED

Abstract:
BadUSB, a well-known firmware attack, performs malicious operations on the victims' devices through disguising ordinary USB devices as human interface devices like keyboards and mice.

However, BadUSB lacks a visual feedback channel to perform precise attacks. This talk introduces BadUSB-C, a new attack tool utilizing USB Type-C. BadUSB-C can obtain real-time UI from the victims' devices leveraging the latest DisplayPort over USB-C protocol.

We build a stealthy prototype which looks like a normal power bank and will demostrate how to hijack a mobile device using it.

Presentation Outline
1. Introduction to USB background
- This will introduce a breif history of USB protocol including the latest USB Type-C features and previous attacks like BadUSB.

2. Ideas and realization of BadUSB-C
- This will present the ideas behind BadUSB-C and how to build a BadUSB-C prototype.

3. Real attack scenario
- This will demostrate a real attack scenario where BadUSB-C is disguised as a sharing power bank and steals victim's money.

Have You Previously Presented This Research or Any Portion of This Talk at Another Conference?

What new research, concept, technique, or approach is included in your submission?
To our best knowledge, this is the first work to utilize new features of USB Type-C. The combination of new support with conventional BadUSB makes attacks more precise and effective.


Takeaways
- USB Type C provides a powerful peripherial without sufficient protection
- BadUSB-C extends BadUSB by providing a real-time visual feedback, which largely enhances its capibility.
- Do not use USB devices especially USB Type-C devices from unknown sources.
