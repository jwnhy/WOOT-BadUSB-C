\begin{abstract}

The security of the \ac{USB} protocol has been paid extensive attention to because of its
    wide usage.  Due to the \textit{trust-by-default} characteristics, \ac{USB}
    security has caused severe problems.  For example, a well-known firmware
    attack, BadUSB, performs malicious operations on the victim hosts through
    disguising ordinary \ac{USB} devices as human interface devices like keyboards and
    mice.  However, BadUSB suffers from several limitations.  Attackers cannot
    obtain the status of \ac{UI} to conduct precise attacks and get the visual feedback of their attacks.  In this work, we
    extended BadUSB to support the new \ac{USB} Type-C features and proposed a
    multi-mode attack model, \tool.  This obtains UI status to make attacks more 
    precise and effective.  To the best of our knowledge, \tool is the first attack model
    utilizing \ac{USB} Type-C.  To validate the usability and effectiveness, we
    conducted extensive experiments to simulate daily usage and summarized the private information collected.
%\fengwei{What results?} \fengwei{what countermeasures do we propose? including
    %isolated UI rendering.}
We also discussed the recommended countermeasures for our attack model,
    including isolated UI rendering, which may be inspiring for future research
    on defense methods.
