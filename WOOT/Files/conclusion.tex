\outline{Conclusion}
Leveraging the new features of USB 3.x~\cite{usb31,usb31,usb32}, we explore a new attack scheme named \tool and three useful attack modes. Each of these three modes has its own strength and use case. The scripting mode largely extends the original BadUSB and successfully bypasses existing defenses. The privacy extraction mode proved practical and powerful in the user study, as it extracts victim's privacy in a stealth way. The remote control mode archives complete hijack of target device, allowing us to perform various type of subsequent attacks. By experimenting \tool in three different devices, we further tests its ability under different mode and proves it can indeed bypass certain defense like GoodUSB~\cite{tian2015defending}. In user study, we obtains and analyzes video stream extracted from 10 participant with \tool, which demonstrates its capability in real life scenario. In the end, we propose a new defense scheme named \textit{isolated UI rendering}, which can effectively stop our \tool.

As future work, we decide to further explore the potential of \textit{isolated UI rendering} and implement it on a customized operating system. Moreover we also hope to lower the power and network requirement of \tool to make it more practical.
