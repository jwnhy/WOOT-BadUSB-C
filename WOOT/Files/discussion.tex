\subsection{Limitation}
There exist multiple limitations of \tool.
To begin with, \tool can only gain the information and control access of the host itself instead of external hardware.
Consequently, as we introduced in the Section\ref{sec:countermeasures}, \tool can hardly bypass the defence approaches which use external hardware for authorization.
Moreover, most of the devices will prompt users to give authentication to the USB devices or select one of the functional modes after they are plugged in.
Though some of such prompts are not conspicuous for non-experts, especially when \tool is concealed within other functional hardware such as power banks \shuqing{If there is experiment, add it here.}, the probability whether users could get aware that something unusual happens will increase with the existence these prompting messages.

\subsection{Impact}
%\shuqing{Left after experiment to finish. Will discuss from different modes and application scenarios.}
The USB protocol is used widely as introduced in preceding sections.
As the technologies develops rapidly, more and more devices will be equipped with USB-C capabilities, which makes \tool more influential.
Due to the neglection to check the security of plugged-in USB devices of non-professional users, \tool can be hardly detected by them while attacks are performing.
The popularity and universality of public USB devices, including sharing power banks, even increase such risks.
What's more, \tool provides a better way for traditional BadUSB attacks, since attackers can obtain the screen streaming with ease.
Attackers can use such technologies to perform more precise attacks, such as interacting with user interface, as well as control the consequences of their attacks.
In summary, \tool can be applied in various application scenarios and brings rather huge impacts.
