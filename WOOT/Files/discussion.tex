\subsection{Limitation}
There exist multiple limitations of \tool.
To begin with, \tool can only gain the information and control access of the host itself instead of external hardware.
Consequently, as we introduced in the Section\ref{sec:countermeasures}, \tool can hardly bypass the defence approaches which use external hardware for authorization.
Moreover, most of the devices will prompt users to give authentication to the USB devices or select one of the functional modes after they are plugged in.
Though some of such prompts are not conspicuous for non-experts, especially when \tool is concealed within other functional hardware such as portable battery \shuqing{If there is experiment, add it here.}, the probability whether users could get aware that something unusual happens will increase with the existence these prompting messages.
