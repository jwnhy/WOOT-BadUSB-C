\noindent\outline{USB Standard}\\
We first introduce the development of USB specification and emphasize the key points adopted in our work.

\noindent\outline{USB1.x}\\
Proposed in 1996, USB 1.0\cite{usb10} was developed to provide an unified interface and thus reducing the cost of re-configuring the software.

USB1.x\cite{usb10}\cite{usb11} provided two data transfer rates which are Low Speed (1.5 Mbit/s) and Full Speed (12 MBit/s). At this point, due to the transfer limit, it only supports limited kinds of devices like keyboard, mice, etc.

\noindent\outline{USB2.0}\\
In 2000, USB2.0\cite{usb20} was released.
