In this part, we survey related works on USB attack security in Section III-A, and USB defence security in Section III-B, respectively.
\subsection{USB Attack Security}
USB 1.0\cite{usb01} was first introduced in 1996, which was designed to provide interfaces for disparate peripherals and reduce the complexity of both hardware design and software configuration\cite{sok}. USB 1.0 provided the data transfer for Low Speed(1.5 Mbit/s) and Full Speed( 12Mbit/s). Before USB 2.0 was released in 2000 and widely used, USB attacks are limited to human layer error attacks, \cite{se}, \cite{goverment}, \cite{atkvec}, \cite{ueerreallydo}, e.g, throwing a bad USB device on purpose, are in order to damage host through plugging in a peripheral by trust default. 

USB 2.0 protocol increased the speed of data transfer and it was also expended to include digit cameras. According to the protocol, the host recognises the peripherals through enumeration, and this gives attacked chance to cheat the host. BadUSB\cite{badusb} is going to attack host by modifying the devices' identify, re-flash the firmware to add more functionalities to the USB devices, for example, it can present malicious interfaces as a sample HID interfaces or work as a network adapter on a USB thumb driver. Other USB attacks, \cite{rubber}, \cite{usbdriver}, \cite{usbbypassing}, \cite{iseeyou} are also masquerading the USB protocol and provided illegal functionality interface to the host, taking advantage of the permissive trust model in USB whereby the host fully trust the devices connected. \cite{syzkaller} use the fact that the host's USB software stack generally expects devices with a standard USB protocol, with the help of fuzzing techniques using FaceDancer \cite{facedancer} and debuggers, it takes a number of vulnerabilities to the kernel-model. Furthermore, expect from the protocol related attack, the radio frequency based sensitive data stealing is another kind of attack, \cite{smartphone} , \cite{poweremi}, \cite{badusbhub}, \cite{usbfinger}, \cite{side}, \cite{usbdriver} work based on signal eavesdropping to attack during the data extraction, and \cite{usbkiller}, \cite{cable}, \cite{usbee}, \cite{turnip} use the RF transmitter to inject signal to cause physical damage to the host machine.    

As our best knowledge, attacks based on USB 3.0\cite{usb03} have not been discovered. In this work, we focus on attack based on USB 3.0 in the layer of transport\cite{sok}, which use the USB protocol to control the host or inject malicious command to the host connected with Type-C\cite{typec}, and streal the data trough it.

\subsection{USB Defence Security}

Tian, Jing, et al.[1] have made a brief overview of the defense countermeasures over four layers attack in the article. For attacks against human-layer problems, [2],[3]raise people's awareness of social engineering,[][][4],[5],[6] prevent the data from being stolen by on-device encryption, [7],[8] provide host authentication, [8]monitor data flow to record potential malicious IO behaviors and [9],[10]block physical connections to defense. In application layer,modification over OS and driver are adapted. [11],[12],[13] harden  host system to prevent automatic execution of malicious code. GOOD USB[14] offers strict access control, with the system soliciting desired functionality from the user and blocking other functionality for a device. Ghost[15] simulates as a USB device to detect if the host has malicious code injection. In transport layer, 

FirmUSB[16] and VIPER[17] check the firmware of the device to ensure its safety. Fuzzing is a method of detecting vulnerabilities by providing unexpected input to the target system and monitoring for abnormal results. Some related work,[][][18],[19],[20] ,focuses on using USB fuzzing approach to detect potential bugs in USB driver. USBFirewall[21] protects the host based on error detection of USB communication packages. In some related work, [14],[22], e. g, VM is deployed in host to interact with the USB device for malicious behavior detection. In physical layer, some related work like [23] consider anti-fingerprinting ,and some others like [24] consider data encryption on USB bus.
