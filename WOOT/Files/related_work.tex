\subsection{USB Attack Security}
While many USB based  attacks have been developed, these attacks are all tied to the environment of the target devices. In addition, limited to the USB 2.0\cite{usb20} specification, there is no video transformation interface, the control of attack processing is impossibly handled by the attackers without additional processing signal received. When the  protocol masquerading attack devices, e.g., Rubbery Ducky\cite{rubber}, \cite{rubberducky2020} and USBderivery\cite{usbdriver}, are connected to the host, they will hide their own functionality with the re-write functionality interface, that works because of the HID enumeration property for USB identifying. Software running on the host will exfiltrate data or receive commands via the RF interface in \cite{turnip} after modified the USB table with an additional RF transmitter. Due to the limitations of USB 2.0, it is impossible to handle the real-time screen information of the host, so only environment fitted commands will work in these scenarios.

In a similar way, \cite{duqu} used a user-mode rootkit to hide malicious files on the USB storage device, zero-day exploits is also developed in \cite{zero-day} to automatically execute malware when the storage devices are connected to the host. Due to the limitation of functionality interface of devices for video transformation, the accuracy timing for wake up the devices is difficult to handle, e.g., executing the malicious code in host's free time, pause the execution processing in the inappropriate time. 

Another kind of attacks for USB \cite{JFC} is to automatically record phone-screen and monitor user's input based on  the Mobile High-Definition Link(MHL) standard. With this approach, it is able to successfully exfiltrate data without the permission on user's side. Due to the limitation of MHL standard, only data exfiltrating without other attack scropt works here, and an additional conversion tool is necessary. Others attacks for USB to exfiltrate data\cite{smartphone}\cite{poweremi} and \cite{usbdriver} are to eavesdrop signal to recovered the sensitive data at the physical layer. Even though the data, including the video data, could be recovered in this way, these attacks for executing malicious code is difficult to work, and the invisibility is a problem cannot be ignored due to the spacial locality of radio frequency. 



Since USB 3.1 was introduced with USB Type-C in 2013, display port and HDMI connectors have been provided by USB Type-C, transformation for video streaming data is guaranteed with the other attacks, e.g., protocol masquerading,  protocol corruption and code injection. This allows attacker to control users' devices with screen monitoring, attacks for interaction work here.

\subsection{USB Defence Security}
There are already some defenses against BadUSB attacks. 
And there has been a comprehensive investigation of previous work.\cite{sok}.
BadUSB attack requires `D-' and `D+' which have been defined by USB protocol since USB 1.0\cite{usb10},
without these special pins, data can't be transferred in the USB cable. USB condom \cite{Condom} proposed a hardware-based solution to prevent data from being transmitted on data channel by adding special hardware between the usb device and host. At this case, `D-' and `D+' are disabled.
However, this method poses a great challenge to ease of use, and once deployed, it will block all USB-supported advanced functions other than charging. Pham et al. \cite{pham2010optimizing}, Metascan \cite{OPSWAT} and odix\cite{OLEA} propose scanning function for files on portable USB devices, and can prevent malicious code over malicious devices from attacking host.
There are also some work like TMSUI\cite{yang2015tmsui} USB
Unix Smart Blocker\cite{diwan2014complete}, which based on the unreliable information provided by USB devices during enumeration to defend against BadUSB attack.

Since USB devices may hide their real functionality from the user. GoodUSB\cite{tian2015defending} will report the functionality and identity information of the device to the user and the user needs to explicitly specify the target functionality of the device. On this basis, GoodUSB loads the corresponding driver for the device, and device can not request other drivers during enumeration or usage. This restricts the device from loading only the drivers allowed by the user, but does not prevent the device from using available drivers to attack. For example, a malicious keyboard can type commands without the user's knowledge after enumeration. Because from the user's perspect, he must permit a USB-based keyboard the corresponding drivers to allow himself to use keyboard to type, but once the drivers are loaded, the malicious usb-based keyboard can also automatically type commands. What's more, in GoodUSB, VM is deployed in host to interact with the USB device to detect malicious behavior like automatic eqxecution of malicious code.
 
Windows Defender ATP\cite{windenfenderwhite} can maintain a white list of USB devices, only if one USB device is in the white list can it interact with host. This prevents all interactions between untrusted devices and the host. But this reduces the ease of use and requires users to have a certain safety awareness. For example, a naive user may add the USB device he found outdoors to his whitelist without precautions. Mohammadmoradi et al\cite{mohammadmoradi2018making} generate unique fingerprint based on the features and functions of the USB device, thereby building a whitelist of USB devices.

Neuner et al.\cite{neuner2018usblock} prevent USB key injection attacks from malicious flash drive by analyze temporal characteristics of BadUSB-like attacks. This defense mechanism can be successful because the attacker cannot obtain the screen of the host based on the BadUSB under USB2.0, so that the malicious device can only inject instructions in a very short time to prevent the user from discovering. This causes the typing characteristics of BadUSB devices to be detected.

Some composite anti-virus systems, like Windows Defender ATP\cite{windenfender} and Metascan\cite{OPSWAT} can sanitize the malicious files in the device to containment of any malware. However, Metascan warned users to be wary of the device plugged into the computer, since there is currently no way to ensure absolutely security.
